/// Global app-level state.
///
/// There are two approaches that are used to update state in this struct:
///
/// ## Replace
/// This is the default apprach that is used to update UI state.
/// Any updated state is entirely replaced (i.e. not mutated) with an updated struct.
/// This is similar to appraches like Redux reducers.
///
/// ## Update in place
/// This is default approach for state that is accessed from the audio thread.
/// Because the audio thread needs a handle to a stable location in memory,
/// these values cannot be replaced. They must be updated in place. The outer handle is cloned, while
/// the inner memory remains consistent. Then, on any state updates, an internal counter in the handle itself
/// is modified so that Yew can compare the previous handle to the new handle and see that the object was updated.
///
/// If we did not update the handle's internal state in some way, Yew would have no way of comparing
/// previous Handles to new Handles, because the outer Handle would be identical in both, and the internal
/// memory/pointer would also be identical.
