/// This is an `Arc` wrapper around `BufferSelection`
///
/// Wrapping `BufferSelection` in an `Arc` allows up-to-date state in BufferSelection to be
/// accesed from within the separate audio thread for up-to-date audio processing.
///
/// When the `BufferHandle` is `Clone`d on global state updates, its clone is the
/// identical object to the original, because the `buffer_selection`'s `Arc` is simply cloned,
/// and the outer struct frame (with the `counter`) is identical.
///
/// This makes it impossible for Yew to know when the `buffer_selection`'s data has actually been
/// udpated internally, because it will always be compared to itself accross state updates.
///
/// For this reason, an internal counter is udated to "force" a difference in state
/// while keeping the underlying `buffer_selection` reference identical in memory.
///
/// This allows Yew to know that internal state has changed, while also keeping the state's
/// location in memory unchanged, so that it can be safely accessed from the audio thread.
